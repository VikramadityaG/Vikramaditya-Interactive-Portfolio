The AI engineer's work involved a thorough understanding of an existing 3D portfolio React application with a FastAPI backend and MongoDB. The initial phase focused on environment setup and codebase exploration. The engineer then systematically addressed user-requested UI/UX improvements: removing the vertical navbar, making the experience section expandable, refining achievements and contact sections, updating profile details (name, title), converting the experience section to a 2D grid, and critically, implementing mobile scrolling and responsive navigation indicators. Each change involved targeted file modifications and was verified with screenshots, demonstrating a clear, iterative development process focused on fulfilling explicit user requirements.

<product_requirements>
The user tasked the AI engineer with improving an existing 3D Portfolio Website. The core problem was to enhance the user experience and update content, moving it from a basic MVP to a more refined state.
The implemented features include:
1.  **Navigation Enhancement**: Remove the existing vertical navbar, making navigation solely reliant on scroll wheel/arrow keys, and later, touch gestures for mobile.
2.  **Experience Section Interactivity**: Make each professional experience entry expandable on click to reveal more details (e.g., responsibilities), initially with vertical alignment, later transitioning to a 2D grid.
3.  **Content Refinement - Achievements**: Remove Special Mentions to streamline the achievements section.
4.  **Content Refinement - Contact**: Remove emojis from the Get in Touch section for a more professional appearance.
5.  **Profile Information Update**:
    *   Change the loading preview title from AR/VR Developer to Software Engineer.
    *   Shorten the displayed name from Vikramaditya Kalyanrao Gaikwad to Vikramaditya Gaikwad globally.
6.  **Professional Experience Layout**: Reconfigure the professional experience section from a vertical list to a responsive 2D grid for better space utilization.
7.  **Contact Information Update**: Update the GitHub link from github.com/vikramad98 to github.com/VikramadityaG.
8.  **Mobile Responsiveness Fixes**: Address non-functional scrolling on mobile devices and conditionally display scroll to explore (desktop only) or swipe to navigate (mobile only) indicators.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with distinct frontend and backend directories.



-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This is the main FastAPI backend application file. It sets up the API routes, handles database connections (MongoDB via Motor), and defines application startup/shutdown events.
    -   **Changes**: No explicit changes were made to this file in the provided trajectory. Its role remained as the backend API server.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The root React component that orchestrates the entire application. It manages the current section, handles navigation logic (scroll, keyboard, and now touch events), and renders different UI components including the 3D scene and HTML overlays.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **Navigation Removal**: Removed the import and rendering of the  component to eliminate the vertical navbar.
        -   **Mobile Touch Scrolling**: Added , , and  event listeners to enable swipe-based navigation for mobile devices.
        -   **Conditional Indicators**: Implemented logic to conditionally render  (for desktop/tablet) and  (for mobile) based on screen width.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Originally responsible for rendering the vertical navigation bar.
    -   **Changes**: This file's usage was removed from , effectively eliminating the vertical navbar. The file itself might still exist but is no longer part of the rendered UI.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This component renders the various 2D HTML overlays for each section (e.g., Education, Experience, Achievements, Contact). It dynamically renders content based on the  prop.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **Experience Section Expansion**: Modified the experience section's rendering (case 3) to include a  hook for toggling expanded details and apply conditional rendering for responsibilities.
        -   **Achievements Refinement**: Removed the Special Mentions sub-section from the achievements rendering (case 6).
        -   **Contact Section Refinement**: Replaced emojis with plain text labels (e.g., Email:, Phone:) in the contact section (case 7).
        -   **Professional Experience Grid Layout**: Updated styling to use  for the experience cards, converting it to a responsive 2D grid.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Displays a loading animation and initial text while the application assets are loading.
    -   **Changes**: The text AR/VR Developer was updated to Software Engineer to reflect the user's updated professional title.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Contains mock data for the portfolio content, including personal details, education, experience, etc.
    -   **Changes**: The full name Vikramaditya Kalyanrao Gaikwad was shortened to Vikramaditya Gaikwad. The GitHub link was updated from github.com/vikramad98 to github.com/VikramadityaG.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Displays a visual indicator prompting users to scroll to explore.
    -   **Changes**: Modified its Tailwind CSS classes to be , ensuring it's only visible on medium-sized screens and up (desktop/tablet).

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: A new component created to display a visual indicator prompting users to swipe to navigate on mobile devices.
    -   **Changes**: This file was created from scratch and then integrated into  with  class to make it visible only on mobile screens.

All explicit requests made by the user in the provided trajectory have been successfully implemented and verified by the AI engineer. There are no pending tasks from the conversation.

<current_work>
The AI engineer's most recent work focused on improving the application's mobile responsiveness and navigation clarity. This involved addressing a critical mobile scrolling issue and refining navigation indicators for different device types.

Specifically, the following was implemented:
1.  **Mobile Touch Scrolling**: Enabled swipe gestures for navigation on mobile devices. This involved adding , , and  event listeners to the  component. Swipe up now moves to the next section, and swipe down moves to the previous section, with a 50px threshold and a 1000ms cooldown to prevent rapid, accidental navigation.
2.  **Responsive Navigation Indicators**:
    *   The existing Scroll to explore indicator () was modified with  Tailwind CSS classes to ensure it only appears on desktop and tablet (screen width >= 768px).
    *   A new component, , was created to display a Swipe to navigate prompt. This component was then integrated into  with  classes, making it visible only on mobile screens (screen width < 768px). This provides clear, context-appropriate navigation hints for users across devices.

The application now seamlessly transitions between desktop (mouse wheel/keyboard navigation with scroll indicator) and mobile (touch swipe navigation with swipe indicator), enhancing the user experience on smaller screens. All previous enhancements, such as the 2D grid experience layout, expandable experience details, refined achievements and contact sections, and updated profile information, remain intact and functional. The services (FastAPI backend, React frontend, MongoDB) are running correctly.
